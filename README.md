### Hi, I'm Andy ðŸ‘‹

#### I am a full stack software engineer and designer.

It's me, Andy Chipres. I've never thought about writing a README for myself. 
Usually README's are written for applications and software, but here I am writing a README about myself. And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the [![Star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/andychipres/andychipres?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/andychipres/andychipres) button.
