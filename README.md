### Hi, I'm Andy 👋

#### I am a full stack software engineer and designer. 

It's me, Andy Chipres. I've never thought about writing a README for myself. 
Usually README's are written for applications and software, but here I am writing a README about myself. And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the star ⭐️ button.

📚 I love to learn and contribute to open-source projects. My GitHub is a collection of projects and experiments that reflect my journey and growth as a developer.

💡 Feel free to explore my repositories and let me know what you think! Contributions and feedback are always welcome.

### On my profile, you'll find projects related to:
   - <strong> Work samples </strong>  
   - <strong> Personal projects </strong>
   - <strong> More projects under development... </strong>
  

📫 You can reach me at andychipres@gmail.com.
