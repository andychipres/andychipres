### Hi, I'm Andy 👋

#### I am a full stack software engineer and designer. 

It's me, Andy Chipres. I've never thought about writing a README for myself. 
Usually README's are written for applications and software, but here I am writing a README about myself. And you cannot star this repo, even if you click the star ⭐️ button.

📚 I love to learn and contribute to open-source projects. My GitHub is a collection of projects and experiments that reflect my journey and growth as a developer.

### Project 1: Fairly
#### Significance:

Working on Fairly holds a special place in my heart as it addresses a critical problem currently happening in the hiring industry today. The goal was to create a platform to enable talent acquisition teams to find and hire high-quality, diverse talent for their company. We wanted to create a brand new social media platform that doesn't discriminate anybody from getting a job based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or background.
